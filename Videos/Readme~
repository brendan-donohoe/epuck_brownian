1. Save all the frames for the simulation having failure in CapturedFrames_withFailure folder
2. Save all the frames for the simulation without failure case CapturedFrames_withoutFailure folder
3. run makeVideoWithFailure.m from matlab to create a video having failure case. It will create a video 'video_withFailure' and save it on current directory.
4. run makeVideoWithoutFailure.m from matlab to create a video without failure case. It will create a video 'video_withoutFailure.avi' and save it on current directory.
